### What I learned

I had already done another card mockup, so this one was fairly easy, as the main elements were broadly similar. Hardest part is getting the alignment as close as possible to the original design. Took me a little while to figure out which blend mode/opacity level to use for the main image!

### Continued development

Going to try a larger project for my next challenge, and I'll see how that goes!!
